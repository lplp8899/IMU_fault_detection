# Usage

**run the main program:**

**1. Run_IOTSEKF_KM1.m** % this one uses the KM1, and only works when there is no turbulence



**2. Run_IOTSEKF_KM2.m** %this one uses the KM2, and still works when there is turbulence


each main program has its own subfunctions, refer to the code for more details.
